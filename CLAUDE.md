# Zernio Library Skills

A library of Claude Code skills for working with [Zernio](https://zernio.com). It currently contains three skills — `zernio-publish` (end-to-end social publishing), `zernio-comment-to-dm` (comment-to-DM automations + DM sequences), and `meta-ads-launch` (Meta ad batches through Zernio's ads API, launch-then-pause). More Zernio-related skills (analytics, account management, content calendaring) get added to `.claude/skills/` as they're built.

This is a **Claude Code skill repo**, not a runtime or SDK project. The agent (Claude) has its native toolkit available — bash, curl, ffmpeg, vision, transcript extraction, web fetching. The skill is *instructions* for using those tools well; it isn't a framework around them.

## How to use this library

1. Drop the `.claude/skills/zernio-publish/` folder into any Claude Code project, OR open this repo directly as a Claude Code project.
2. Edit `.env` to put your real `ZERNIO_API_KEY` in place of the placeholder. Then `git update-index --skip-worktree .env` to keep your key out of commits.
3. Talk to Claude. Drop a video file, paste a Drive link, describe what you want to publish — Claude reads `SKILL.md`, follows the workflow, and ships.

The agent uses its own tools — `source .env` to load the key, `curl -L` for URLs and Drive single-file shares, `ffmpeg` for video format conversion, vision to read images, transcript tools for video/audio. There are no helper scripts in this repo; the agent doesn't need them.

## Adding more skills to the library

The point of the "library" name: more Zernio-related skills land here as they're built. To add one:

1. Create `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and the skill's instructions.
2. Optional: add `reference/` for deep docs the skill pulls on demand, `templates/` for reusable shapes.
3. The bundled `skill-creator` at `.claude/skills/skill-creator/` is Anthropic's official tool for designing and improving skills — invoke it when building a new one.

## Hard rules embedded in `zernio-publish`

These four constraints live inside `SKILL.md`. They prevent real damage, not autonomy:

- **Approval before publish.** Show the full package, wait for an explicit OK.
- **Verify after publish.** Zernio's 200 OK ≠ landed on the platform.
- **`scheduledFor` 2-3 min ahead** for multi-platform. Never `publishNow: true`.
- **Zernio only.** No Late, Buffer, Hootsuite, or any alternative posting tool.

Everything else is judgment.
